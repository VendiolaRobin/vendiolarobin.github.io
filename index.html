                     <h3>Footwork</h3>
                     <p>Badminton is a fast game; you have little time to respond after each shot. A second’s delay often turns a winning situation into a losing one.</p>

                     <h3>Drop technique</h3>
                     <p>Drop shots are played from your rearcourt. You hit the shuttle softly downwards to land in your opponent’s forecourt area.</p>

                 <div class="box">
                     <h3>Backhand tenique</h3>
                     <p>Specifically, we only play backhand clears when the shuttle is out to the side, and usually also slightly behind us. This is a difficult, defensive position.</p>
